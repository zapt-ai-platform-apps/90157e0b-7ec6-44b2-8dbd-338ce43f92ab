# Submit an Appeal

1. After reviewing the introduction, you can begin the multi-step form by clicking "Start Your Appeal."
2. On the form screens:
   - Provide your personal details (name, address, email, phone).
   - Enter ticket details: date the ticket was issued, location, ticket reference, and issuer information (issuer name, address, etc.).
   - Select all applicable reasons for your appeal (e.g., insufficient signage, grace period, etc.). If “Other” applies, you can provide your own text.
   - Optionally upload files as supporting evidence.
3. Navigate through each step by clicking “Next.” You can go back if needed to revise answers.
4. Proceed to the final step, where you can review your information before submission.
5. When ready, you can also see a “Likely Success” analysis and generate a final appeal letter in a structured format.
