# Park Appeal UK

Park Appeal UK helps drivers understand the differences between official “penalty charge notices” (PCNs) and private parking tickets under UK law, gather information about their specific situation, and determine whether they have grounds for appeal. Users can generate a customized appeal letter and optionally upload photos as evidence.
